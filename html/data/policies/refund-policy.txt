At AccBuddy, we value customer satisfaction and strive to provide top-quality online accounts. If for any reason you are not pleased with your purchase, we offer the following refund policy:

Refunds:
We offer refunds for all online accounts as long as they have not been activated or used. Please note that we cannot issue a refund for any accounts that have already been activated or used.

30-Day Money-Back Guarantee:
If you are not satisfied with your purchase and the online account has not been activated or used, we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. To initiate a refund, please contact us by email at support@accbuddy.com or use the contact form on our website. In your message, include your order number, the type of account, and the reason for the refund request. Our customer service team will review your request and provide further instructions.

Refund Process:
All refunds will be credited back to the original payment method, whether it is a credit card, PayPal account, or cryptocurrency wallet. The duration it takes for the refund to appear in your account will depend on your payment provider.

We hope this policy provides you with clarity and confidence in our services. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact our customer service team.
