At AccBuddy, we accept payments for our online accounts through PayPal, all major credit/debit cards processed by PayPal, and cryptocurrencies.

Full payment must be made at the time of purchase. Please note that we will not deliver or provide access to any online accounts until we have received payment in full.

Your security and privacy are of the utmost importance to us. That's why we use PayPal for processing card payments, and a secure, encrypted system for cryptocurrency payments. These systems ensure that your personal and financial information remains protected. Please note that we do not store or have access to your credit card, PayPal account information, or cryptocurrency wallet details.

If you experience any issues during the payment process, or have any related questions, please don't hesitate to contact us at support@accbuddy.com.

By making a purchase on our website, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Payment Policy.
