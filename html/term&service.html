                            These terms describe the relationship between you and Google. They don’t create any
                            legal rights for other people or organizations, even if others benefit from that
                            relationship under these terms.
                            <br><br>
                            We want to make these terms easy to understand, so we’ve used examples from our
                            services. But not all services mentioned may be available in your country.

                            If these terms conflict with the service-specific additional terms, the additional
                            terms will govern for that service.
                            If it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not
                            affect any other terms.
                            If you don’t follow these terms or the service-specific additional terms, and we
                            don’t take action right away, that doesn’t mean we’re giving up any rights that we
                            may have, such as taking action in the future.
                            <br><br>
                            We may update these terms and service-specific additional terms (1) to reflect
                            changes in our services or how we do business — for example, when we add new
                            services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for
                            legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.
                            <br><br>
                            If we materially change these terms or service-specific additional terms, we’ll
                            provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the
                            changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent
                            situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements. If
                            you don’t agree to the new terms, you should remove your content and stop using the
                            services. You can also end your relationship with us at any time by closing your
